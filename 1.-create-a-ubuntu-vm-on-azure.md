#### Enter a name you want for your virtual machine \(e.g. Ubuntu16\), and a public key file \(.pub\) in ssh-rsa format. Or you can choose to set a password instead for now.  Pick a  subscription you have \(e.g. Free Trial\), as well as a new or existing Resource group \(this can be used to set rules, polices, e.g. set to open port 80\) and a data-center location you prefer. 

#### Now pick a size that fits the need \(e.g. the Basic B1s - 1GB RAM 4GB Local SSD\):

#### And configure the optional features, where you can set the Public IP address as Static \(optional\), select "SSH\(22\)" as public inbound ports and leave the rest as default:
